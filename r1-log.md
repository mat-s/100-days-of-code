## Log

### Day 1: January 26, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Started to go on the Jamstack journey. To day I started to plan my content structure model, fooled a bit around with Lucid.app and then set up the first content types in Contentful. 

### Day 2: January 27, 2021
**Today's Progress**: I worked more on the content model and included the first dummy content in Contentful. Normaly using Sublime to code, I installed VS Code to also learn another editor. Then I set up a Gatsby project and connected it to Contentful. Having both up and running, I started digging a bit with GraphQL 

### Day 3: January 28, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Today I worked more on my first Gatsby steps on bringing the content from Contentful into my code. Very basic Gatsby steps.

### Day 4: January 29, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Today I fouled around in Gatsby and React, but often ended up doing things without understanding the background. Tomorrow I will take a step back and go a bit more over the basics again, not forcing to directly meet my project ideas 

### Day 5: January 30, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Today I learned more about the basics in Gatsby

### Day 14&15: February 09, 2021
**Today's Progress**: I did some more fine tuning in the Gatsby blog project. After that I researched and learned more about the combination of Wordpress as a headless CMS in combination with Gatsby. 

### Day 16: February 10, 2021
**Today's Progress**: I started a new project to set up an address book with Wordpress as a headless CMS and Gatsby, just to practise the combination of the two of them. Today I just made a rough plan, set up the two test enviroments and connected them with the help of the gatsby-source-wordpress plugin. 

### Day 17: February 11, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Very little time today, I only learned one hour. I created a couple of custom fields in Wordpress and got them into my GraphQL. From there I included them into the Gatsby page. I hope I can do more tomorrow.

### Day 18: February 12, 2021
**Today's Progress**: A little excurse into the world of oauth today: I played around with the Facebook graph explorer and learnd how to get all the credentials to access it. 

### Day 19: February 13, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Today I continued with my address book tool. I set up a custom post type in Wordpress and created the neccessary custom fields. As I want to import contacts from different sources, I started to write a import tool. So today it was mostly PHP work...

### Day 20: February 14, 2021
**Today's Progress**: A very unsuccessful day, still working on the importer plugin for Wordpress. And I got stuck with a PHP problems that slowed down the learning progress today. Well, I will have learned a lot when I solve that problem ;) Hopefully tomorrow...

### Day 21 &22: February 16, 2021
**Today's Progress**: I got my import tool to work and was then finally able to head over to Gatsby and GraphQL then. I learned to include custom post types into GraphQL and also how to include custom fields within these custom post types

### Day 23 &24: February 18, 2021

### Day 32 &33: March 1, 2021
**Today's Progress**: The last two days I got caught up in a Wordpress problem with custom taxonomies and translations. I am still trying to solve that problem, but the learnings are soo far lower then the frustration... It is good to know that there is a big learning at the end of that ;)
