# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Matthias Seidel

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 26, Tuesday, 2021].

## Log

### Day 1: January 26, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Started to go on the Jamstack journey. To day I started to plan my content structure model, fooled a bit around with Lucid.app and then set up the first content types in Contentful. 

### Day 2: January 27, 2021
**Today's Progress**: I worked more on the content model and included the first dummy content in Contentful. Normaly using Sublime to code, I installed VS Code to also learn another editor. Then I set up a Gatsby project and connected it to Contentful. Having both up and running, I started digging a bit with GraphQL 

### Day 3: January 28, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Today I worked more on my first Gatsby steps on bringing the content from Contentful into my code. Very basic Gatsby steps.

### Day 4: January 29, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Today I fouled around in Gatsby and React, but often ended up doing things without understanding the background. Tomorrow I will take a step back and go a bit more over the basics again, not forcing to directly meet my project ideas
