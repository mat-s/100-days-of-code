### Day 4: October 18, 2019
**Today's Progress**: I worked with Howler.js and WebaudioRecorder.js again and fixed an error occuring in the rendering of the mp3. The audio is generated and can be downloaded now. Then I started with the tutorial for a little Javascript game: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript

### Day 7: October 21, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Today I started with the tutorial for a little Javascript Tron game: https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/building-a-classic-arcade-game-with-javascript-and-html5-canvas-18494e4201ba It is based on ES6 and I got stuck with some parsing problems with my setup. Could not fix it today, but will try to get it done tomorrow

### Day 8: October 22, 2019
**Today's Progress**: I continued with the tutorial for a little Javascript Tron game. The parsing problems from yesterday were quickly resolved today. 

### Day 9: October 23, 2019
**Today's Progress**: I finished the tutorial for the Javascript Tron game. The tutorial wasn't really good as it is lacking any explanation and also no real coding architecture practices 

### Day 10: October 24, 2019
**Today's Progress**: With yesterdays tutorial I realized that it doesn't make sense to just do random tuorials. I need something with more structure which is build on each other. So I started to read the book "Eloqunet JavaScript" by Marijn Haverbeke today. So far I am going only through the basics to find the right spot for me to start learning.

### Day 11: October 25, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Today I continued to read "Eloquent Javascript" to find my starting point to learn new stuff. I read basic stuff about Bindings, Scopes, Nested Scopes, Closures and Recursions

### Day 12: October 26, 2019
**Today's Progress**: I continued to read "Eloquent Javascript" to find my starting point to learn new stuff. I read basic stuff about Functions, Arrays and Objects

### Day 13: October 27, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Cheating day: Today I had to combine work and learning as I am having a tight deadline for tomorrow. So I worked on a Javascript step sequencer for a client. You can play along with the sounds, create an album cover and send both with a from to participate in a contest. The Song and the album cover is then saved in within Wordpress. 

### Day 14: October 28, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Today I was working on the Javascript step sequencer again, but was also able to do my daily challenge part. So I continued reading about arrays and object and all the magic that you can do with them.

### Day 15: October 29, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Finally I started to make my hands dirty and began to coding again. I did some of the example exercises of chapter 4 of "Eloquent Javascript". 

### Day 16: October 30, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Today I did some of the example exercises of chapter 4 of "Eloquent Javascript" and read a bit further about higher order functions 

### Day 17: October 31, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Cheating day: Today I couldn't find the time to focus on the challenge. I had to work on an urgent project instead, but tried to do standards in a new way. So I learned new ways to deal with custom post types, captchas in Wordpress and experimented a bit with the ScrollMagic.js libary

### Day 18: November 1, 2019
**Today's Progress**: I continued to read "Eloquent Javascript" chapter 5 about higher order functions. Besides that I made some research about some more fun tutorials to go through on days without being to enthusiastic

### Day 19: November 2, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Today I digged a bit into ScrollMagic.js and what is possible with it regarding parallax websites. It was fun to go through some tutorials 

### Day 20: November 3, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Cheating Day: Due to a deadline I included my challenge into work again. So I was working with some image scalling todos, more ScrollMagic.js and DOM manipulation. Right now I am really struggeling timewise.

### Day 21: November 4, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Today I went through a bit more of higher order functions. I want realize that I often think to much of one-step-at-a-time, so I want to practice higher functions a bit more in detail. 

### Day 22: November 6, 2019
**Today's Progress**: I had to pause a day because of work. But today I started to code again and spent some more time on the chapter for higher order functions. I still often have a knot in my head, so I want to stay with that chapter until it goes smoother

### Day 23: November 7, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Today I learnt a bit more about encapsulation, prototypes, classes, maps and polymorphism in Javascript.

### Day 24: November 8, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Today I read about symbols, the iterator interface, getters&setters, statics and inheritance.

### Day 25: November 9, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Today I set up a fun project to have a little bit more practice. As I am playing in a cover band, I want to set up a Wordpress plugin for the song managment. The user should be able to upload songs, categorize them, add infos like the key, musicians, etc. to it and generate playlists with it, to practise these lists for concerts. Todays work was to setup Wordpress, a Plugin-Draft, create the custom post types and a custom admin menu.

### Day 26: November 10, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Today I spent some more time on preparing my song manager plugin for Wordpress. I defined more details about the custom post types and included first custom fields and created custom taxonomies. Not much progress though, but anyways, it is Sunday ;) Will do tomorrow...

### Day 27: November 12, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Today I researched more about CSS Grids and React to combine it with a headless Wordpress for my Song Manager project.

### Day 28: November 13, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about CSS Properties and more about CSS Grids and about the basics of React.

### Day 29: November 19, 2019
**Today's Progress**: I had to skip some days because of a cold and my sister visiting me. Now back in the game with setting up my React enviroment and starting with "React - The Complete Guide" 

### Day 30: November 20, 2019
**Today's Progress**: I continued with "React - The Complete Guide" and learned a lot about working lists and conditionals

### Day 31: November 21, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Today I started to implement the first React components for my song manager tool. So I created a song list and a player and did the CSS for it as well. After that I continued with "React - The Complete Guide"
